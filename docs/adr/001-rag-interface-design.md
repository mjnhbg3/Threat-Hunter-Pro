# ADR-001: RAG Interface Design

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-08-01  
**Decision Makers**: Architecture Team  

## Context

The current Threat Hunter Pro system has tightly coupled web handlers that directly call various AI and database operations. This makes the system difficult to test, modify, and scale. We need to introduce a clean abstraction layer that decouples the web interface from the underlying storage and AI operations while enabling advanced RAG capabilities.

## Decision

We will implement a **RAG Interface Layer** that serves as a stable contract between the web application and the underlying data/AI services. This interface will provide five core operations:

```python
class RAGInterface:
    async def retrieve(self, query: str, context: Dict[str, Any], 
                      filters: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> RetrievalResult
    
    async def summarize(self, content: List[Dict[str, Any]], 
                       scope: str = "cluster") -> SummaryResult
    
    async def relate(self, entities: List[str], 
                    timeframe: str = "24h") -> RelationshipResult
    
    async def trend(self, patterns: List[str], 
                   period: str = "7d") -> TrendResult
    
    async def explain(self, findings: Dict[str, Any], 
                     evidence: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> ExplanationResult
```

### Design Principles

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each method has a clear, focused purpose
2. **Async-First**: All operations are asynchronous for better performance
3. **Type Safety**: Strong typing with Pydantic models for all inputs/outputs
4. **Extensibility**: Interface can be extended without breaking existing code
5. **Testability**: Easy to mock and test in isolation

### Interface Methods

#### `retrieve(query, context, filters)`
- **Purpose**: Execute intelligent hybrid search across all available data sources
- **Routing**: Delegates to Agent Router for strategy selection
- **Capabilities**: Vector search, keyword search, agentic search, metadata filtering
- **Returns**: Ranked, deduplicated results with confidence scores

#### `summarize(content, scope)`
- **Purpose**: Generate hierarchical summaries at various granularities
- **Scopes**: "cluster", "daily", "weekly", "monthly", "quarterly"
- **Intelligence**: Uses LLMs to create human-readable summaries
- **Returns**: Structured summaries with key insights and statistics

#### `relate(entities, timeframe)`
- **Purpose**: Analyze relationships between security entities over time
- **Entities**: IPs, hosts, users, processes, files, etc.
- **Analysis**: Temporal correlation, communication patterns, shared events
- **Returns**: Relationship graph with strength scores and timelines

#### `trend(patterns, period)`
- **Purpose**: Identify trends and anomalies in security patterns
- **Patterns**: Alert types, entity behaviors, system activities
- **Analysis**: Statistical analysis, anomaly detection, forecasting
- **Returns**: Trend data with statistical significance and projections

#### `explain(findings, evidence)`
- **Purpose**: Generate detailed explanations of security findings
- **Context**: Uses comprehensive evidence to build explanations
- **Intelligence**: LLM-powered analysis with citation of evidence
- **Returns**: Human-readable explanations with supporting evidence links

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Direct Refactoring
- **Approach**: Refactor existing handlers without abstraction layer
- **Pros**: Simpler initial implementation, fewer moving parts
- **Cons**: Continued tight coupling, difficult to test, hard to enhance
- **Rejected**: Does not meet modularity and testability requirements

### Alternative 2: Microservices Architecture
- **Approach**: Split into separate services for each capability
- **Pros**: Maximum modularity, independent scaling, fault isolation
- **Cons**: Complex deployment, network overhead, data consistency challenges
- **Rejected**: Over-engineered for current scale, increases operational complexity

### Alternative 3: Plugin Architecture
- **Approach**: Plugin system with swappable implementations
- **Pros**: Maximum flexibility, third-party extensions possible
- **Cons**: Complex plugin management, versioning challenges, over-engineering
- **Rejected**: Adds unnecessary complexity for current requirements

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Modularity**: Clean separation between web layer and business logic
- **Testability**: Easy to unit test each component in isolation
- **Flexibility**: Can swap storage engines or AI models without changing web layer
- **Observability**: Central point for adding tracing, metrics, and logging
- **Future-Proofing**: Interface can accommodate new RAG capabilities

### Negative
- **Initial Complexity**: Additional abstraction layer adds some complexity
- **Performance Overhead**: Small overhead from additional function calls
- **Migration Effort**: Requires refactoring all existing web handlers

### Neutral
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to understand new interface patterns
- **Documentation**: Need comprehensive documentation for interface usage

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Interface Definition
1. Define Pydantic models for all inputs and outputs
2. Create abstract base class with method signatures
3. Add comprehensive type hints and documentation

### Phase 2: Basic Implementation
1. Implement basic versions of all five methods
2. Route to existing functionality where possible
3. Add comprehensive error handling and logging

### Phase 3: Handler Migration
1. Refactor web handlers to use RAG interface
2. Remove direct dependencies on AI and database modules
3. Add integration tests to verify behavior preservation

### Phase 4: Enhanced Features
1. Implement agentic search in retrieve method
2. Add hierarchical summarization
3. Implement relationship and trend analysis

## Monitoring and Success Criteria

### Success Metrics
- **Functionality**: 100% of existing web routes work identically
- **Performance**: Interface overhead < 10ms per operation
- **Test Coverage**: >90% coverage for interface implementation
- **Documentation**: Complete API documentation with examples

### Monitoring
- **Response Times**: Track interface method execution times
- **Error Rates**: Monitor interface method failure rates
- **Usage Patterns**: Track which methods are used most frequently
- **Resource Usage**: Monitor memory and CPU impact of interface layer

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Performance Degradation
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive benchmarking before and after implementation
- **Monitoring**: Real-time performance metrics with alerting
- **Rollback**: Feature flags to disable interface layer if needed

### Risk: Interface Breaking Changes
- **Mitigation**: Versioned interface with backward compatibility
- **Testing**: Comprehensive integration tests for all interface methods
- **Documentation**: Clear API versioning and deprecation policies

### Risk: Team Adoption
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive training and documentation
- **Support**: Dedicated support during migration period
- **Examples**: Clear examples and best practices documentation
