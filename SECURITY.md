# Threat Hunter Pro: Security Model

## Security Overview
Threat Hunter Pro implements a comprehensive, multi-layered security approach designed to protect sensitive information and ensure robust access control.

## Authentication and Access Control

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Enforced for all administrative and API access
- Supports multiple authentication factors
- Configurable MFA policies

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Granular permission management
- Pre-defined roles with specific access levels
- Dynamic role assignment

### Authentication Mechanisms
- HTTP Basic Authentication
- API Key Management
- Token-based authentication
- Support for external identity providers

## Data Protection

### PII (Personally Identifiable Information) Handling
- Automatic PII detection using NER
- Configurable redaction strategies
- Compliance with GDPR, HIPAA regulations

### Encryption
- In-transit encryption (TLS 1.3)
- At-rest encryption for sensitive data
- Secure key management

## Input Validation and Sanitization

### Request Validation
- Strict input type checking
- Schema-based validation
- Protection against injection attacks
- Rate limiting and request throttling

### Output Encoding
- Contextual output encoding
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) prevention
- Content security policy enforcement

## Audit and Compliance

### Comprehensive Logging
- Immutable audit log storage
- Detailed event tracking
- Log rotation and archival
- Compliance-ready log format

### Monitoring and Alerting
- Real-time security event monitoring
- Anomaly detection
- Automated incident response triggers

## Secure Configuration

### Secrets Management
- Environment-based configuration
- No hardcoded credentials
- Secrets rotation mechanism
- Integration with external secret managers

### Dependency Security
- Regular dependency vulnerability scanning
- Automated security patch management
- Bill of Materials (BOM) tracking

## Network Security

### API Security
- API rate limiting
- JWT token validation
- CORS configuration
- IP-based access restrictions

### Container Security
- Minimal attack surface Docker images
- Non-root container execution
- Image vulnerability scanning

## Compliance Frameworks

### Supported Compliance Standards
- GDPR
- HIPAA
- SOC 2
- ISO 27001
- NIST SP 800-53

## Security Testing

### Continuous Security Validation
- Automated penetration testing
- Static and dynamic code analysis
- Regular security assessments
- Bug bounty program integration

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Handling
- Predefined incident response workflows
- Automated initial triage
- Integration with SIEM systems
- Forensic data preservation

## Best Practices and Recommendations

1. Regularly update dependencies
2. Use strong, unique passwords
3. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication
4. Implement least-privilege access
5. Conduct periodic security audits
6. Monitor and log all critical events
